# Inverse Kinematics Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects focusing on Inverse Kinematics (IK) simulations using the Tkinter library. IK is a fascinating field in robotics and computer graphics that deals with the calculation of joint angles in arm-like structures.

## What is Inverse Kinematics?

Inverse Kinematics is a mathematical approach used to solve the problem of determining the joint configurations necessary for a robotic arm or articulated structure to reach a specific target position. Unlike Forward Kinematics, which calculates the end-effector's position given joint angles, IK works in the reverse direction. It is particularly useful in robotics, animation, and game development for achieving natural and efficient motion planning.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains various IK projects, each exploring different aspects and applications of Inverse Kinematics. Projects may include:

Completed Projects:
- **Segmented Arm Simulations:** Projects like the one in this repository, where you can interact with a simulated robotic arm and see how it adjusts its configuration to follow the mouse cursor.

Future projects:
- **3D Robotic Arm Simulations:** More advanced projects that involve 3D graphics and demonstrate IK in a three-dimensional space.

## How to Use the Projects

Typically, you can run the Python scripts provided and interact with the simulations using the code. These projects are small, therefore I chose not to spend too much time on GUI interactions.

Make sure you have the required dependencies, such as NumPy and Tkinter, etc. installed on your system.
